# 🖥️ RodipOS

**RodipOS** is an experimental operating system written completely from scratch in **Assembly** and **C**.  
We take inspiration from **TempleOS** and **Linux**, but our goal is to build our own path.

---

## 🧩 Technologies
- **Assembly**  
- **C**  
- Toolchain: `NASM`, `GCC cross-compiler`, `QEMU`  

---

## 🎯 Goals
We aim to create a functional OS:  
- Custom bootloader  
- Kernel with process and memory management  
- Simple filesystem  
- Basic Unix-style utilities  

---

## 🏗️ Project Status
⚡ Currently in active development. The kernel is in its early stages, but we are moving forward quickly.
